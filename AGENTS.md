## Important Instructions

- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

### GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

### Git

- Do NOT commit to the 'main' or 'master' branches for any reason.

### Playwright (or similar browser automation tool calls)

- Ensure any programs / browsers opened by the AI are subsequently closed by the AI once the AI is done using them.

### Python

- Your primary method for interacting with python should be uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Typescript / Javascript

- Your primary method for interacting with javascript / typescript should be bun (https://bun.com/docs)

### Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- **Linting**: `bun run check` (runs Biome linter and formatter with auto-fix)
- **Type checking**: `bun run check-types` (runs TypeScript compiler check)
- **Development**: `bun run dev:f` (builds and runs frontend on port 3001)
- **Backend development**: `bun run dev:b` (runs Convex backend in parallel)
- **Build**: `bun run build` (builds both frontend and backend)
- **Frontend build only**: `bun run build:frontend`
- **Backend deploy**: `bun run build:backend` (deploys to Convex)
- **Convex codegen**: `bun run convex:codegen` (generates TypeScript types)
- **Convex dev**: `bun run convex:dev` (starts Convex development server)

## Code Style Guidelines

### Imports & Aliases

- Use path aliases: `@/` for `src/`, `@/components/`, `@/hooks/`, `@/lib/`, `@/routes/`
- Import React components with absolute paths from aliases
- Organize imports: external libraries first, then internal modules

### Formatting & Linting

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (configured in Biome)
- **Line width**: 100 characters
- **Semicolons**: as-needed (Biome config)
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for strings
- **Auto-organize imports**: Enabled in Biome

### TypeScript & Types

- **Strict mode**: Enabled
- Use explicit return types for functions
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use generic types properly for reusable components

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `PollCard`, `CreatePollDialog`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `poll-card.tsx`, `use-create-poll.ts`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `pollData`, `isLoading`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)

### React Patterns

- Use functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks in `@/hooks/` directory
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional Tailwind classes
- Prefer `const` over `let` for variables that don't need reassignment
- Use `async/await` for async operations

### Error Handling

- Use error boundaries for component-level error handling
- Return early from functions on validation errors
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

### File Structure

- Components in `src/components/` with index.tsx re-exports
- Routes in `src/routes/` using file-based routing
- Shared utilities in `src/lib/`
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Place UI components in `src/components/ui/` for shadcn/ui components

### TanStack Router

- Use file-based routing with `createFileRoute`
- Routes auto-generated by TanStack Router plugin
- Use `useLoaderData`, `useParams`, `useSearch` hooks
- Handle navigation with `Link` component from TanStack Router

### Testing

- No test framework detected - add tests as needed
- Use Bun test runner when adding tests
- Test files should be co-located with components they test

### Convex Backend

- Schema defined in `convex/schema.ts`
- Functions in `convex/` directory
- Use generated types from `convex/_generated/`
